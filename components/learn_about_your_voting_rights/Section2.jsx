      <p>
        A voter is a person who has a right to participate in an election by an
        elector. In Nigeria, a voter is a citizen who is 18 years old and above
        and is duly registered whose names and details are in the register of
        voter. In effect, anyone who can exercise the right to vote is a voter.
        However, not all voters can be voted for. Anyone who contests in an
        election and votes is not only a voter for the purpose of that election,
        but also a candidate. He therefore plays a dual role at the time he is
        standing for an election. In the Nigerian context, such a person can
        only contest as a candidate on the platform or sponsorship of a
        political party.
